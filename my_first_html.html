        <li>Preheat oven to 400 degrees and grease a large baking pan. Arrange salmon fillets on the baking sheet and season generously with salt and pepper.
        <li>Stir together olive oil, garlic, herbs, and juice of 1/2 lemon. Spoon over salmon fillets being sure to rub all over the tops and sides of the salmon, so it has no dry spots.
        <li>Thinly slice remaining 1/2 of lemon and top each piece of salmon with a slice of lemon.
        <li>Bake for 12-15 minutes until salmon is opaque and flaky when pulled apart with a fork. You can broil the last 1-2 minutes if desired.
        <li>Garnish with fresh thyme or parsley if desired and serve.
